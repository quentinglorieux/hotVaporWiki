# How to fill a cell
- To fill a cell, you can use the `fill` method. This method takes a value and fills the cell with it.
- The value can be a single value or a list of values. If it is a list of values, the cell will be filled with the values in the list in order.
- If the cell is already filled, the `fill` method will overwrite the existing value.
- If the cell is not filled, the `fill` method will fill the cell with the value.
